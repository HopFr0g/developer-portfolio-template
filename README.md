# Developer Portfolio Template

A template to share a developer's knowledge and projects. Its main feature is to **avoid hardcoding**: all the text, images and lists shown in this portfolio can be edited from .json files, without the need to modify the html, css or js code.

## Use it to include:

- External links to your completed projects.
- Local html files with small frontend demos.
- List of your languages, frameworks and tools.
- A short description of your professional profile.
- Your name (obviously).
